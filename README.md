This repository contains a PyTorch based implementation of the framework for the paper "Let's face it: Probabilistic multi-modal interlocutor-aware generation of facial gestures in dyadic settings.", which received the Best Paper Award at IVA'20.

Please read more on the [project website](https://jonepatr.github.io/lets_face_it/)


## Installations

1. Install Docker

We recommend installing the latest version of the Docker as described [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)

2. Build the Docker image
```
docker build -f containers/glow_Dockerfile . -t lets_face_it_glow
```

3. Setup GPU usage for the docker

By following the instructions in [the official tutorial](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)

## Model training and testing

1. Train the model
```
docker run --gpus 1 -v <path/to/the/dataset>:/data lets_face_it_glow python code/glow_pytorch/train.py code/glow_pytorch/hparams/final_model.yaml
```
where `path/to/the/dataset` should be replaced with the path to the dataset on your machine

Customizing
Most of the model parameters are defined in `code/glow_pytorch/hparams/final_model.yaml`. 
Other configurations are set in `code/config.toml`


## Feature extraction and rendering
Instructions coming in a few days!
